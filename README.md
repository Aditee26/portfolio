My Portfolio Website
A pixel-themed developer portfolio that shows who I am, what I build, and how I solve problems.

🎮 What's This?
My personal portfolio site built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no bloat - just clean code that works. It's got that retro gaming vibe because why should websites be boring?

🛠️ What I Used
HTML5 - For the bones
CSS3 - For the looks (with some cool grid/flexbox magic)
JavaScript - For the brains
GitHub - For hosting images

🔧 How It's Built
The Structure:
text
Single HTML file (because I like keeping things simple)
├── Loading screen (makes it feel like an actual game)
├── Header with pixel-perfect navigation
├── Hero section (that's me!)
├── About & Skills (what I know)
├── Projects (what I've built)
├── LeetCode stats (how I practice)
├── Certifications (what I've learned)
└── Contact (how to reach me)

Cool Stuff Inside:
Pixel buttons that actually look clickable
Project cards that flip and stuff 
Certification carousel I coded from scratch

🎯 Why I Built It This Way
No frameworks - Wanted to prove I actually understand how the web works
Single HTML file - Easy to deploy, easy to maintain
Custom everything - No Bootstrap, no templates
Fast loading - Because nobody likes waiting

open index.html  # On Mac

🎨 Customizing for Yourself
Want to use this for your portfolio? Go for it. Just:
Replace my info with yours
Update the projects section
Change the colors if you want (CSS variables at the top)
Don't forget to update the certs and links

⚠️ Things to Know
Profile picture loads from assets/profile.png - make sure you have one
Certificates are hosted on my GitHub - you'll need to host your own
Resume PDF is linked from my GitHub - update the URL
It's all in one file because I like it that way

📱 Works On
Chrome (obviously)
Firefox (yeah, that too)
Safari (if you're into Macs)
Probably your smart fridge (haven't tested that yet because paiso ki kami)

🤔 FAQ
Q: Why no React/Vue/Angular?
A: Because sometimes simple is better. Also, it loads faster.
Q: Can I really use this for my portfolio?
A: Yes! Just give credit somewhere if you're feeling nice.
Q: Is it really just one HTML file?
A: Yep. Check the source. It's all there.
